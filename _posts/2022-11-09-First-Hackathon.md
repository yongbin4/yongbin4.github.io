## First_Hackathon_Project

I joined on a hacked beta which held by computer engineering club in University of Alberta. 
I get to meet great teammates, Johmin, Taekwan, Dohyun, Jungeun. 
This is my first experience with the hackathon. I had no idea how it goes and we didn't prepare much. 
But we divided our roles before we participate. I was a front-end developer. 
I reviewed HTML, CSS before the hackathon. I learned about bootstrap night before the hackathon. 
It is a great framework to build an web application.

## Things I have learned

I learned that bootstrap is a great tool to build simple interative website. It's website explain their functions quite straight forward! Check this out here: [bootstrap Website link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/). 

## Next Step

Our team are planning to join hackathon next year with better knowledge on a software developing. Unfortunately, this hackathon, we couldn't compete with other teams because we had 3rd and 4th year student in our team. It was a entry-level hackathon. I have learned great deal from this project. We made many mistakes in this project. We had an amazing ideas. However, we couldn't make it with the skills we had. Also, we had big issue with a dependencies. Our work has divided in three parts. Full-stack team, Web scrapping team, mahcine learning team. We all used different libraries and tools. It made very hard for me to combine all that. Next time, we ought to plan out all our dependencies and program language before programming starts.
