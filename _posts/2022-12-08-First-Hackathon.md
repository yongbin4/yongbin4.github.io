# First_Hackathon_Project

I joined on a hacked beta which held by computer engineering club in University of Alberta. I get to meet great teammates, Johmin, Taekwan, Dohyun, Jungeun. This is my first experience with the hackathon. I had no idea how it goes and we didn't prepare much. But we divided our roles before we participate. I was a front-end developer. I reviewed HTML, CSS before the hackathon. I learned about bootstrap night before the hackathon. It is a great framework to build an web application.
