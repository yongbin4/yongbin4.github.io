**Welcomeüôå**, this is my first jekyll blog post.

Hello ‚úåÔ∏è, 
My name is Yongbin Kim. I am from South Korea. I moved to U.A.E when I was 9th grade. 
Now I am studying computer science at University of Alberta. From this blog, I want to
introduce important programming skills I have learned and projects that I want to intorduce.
Hopefully anyone view my blog have the virtual experience of my work. 
I am very passionate programer, enjoy solving problems. Not only coding problems but
social problems with my software skills. Recently started startup company with my good friends.
