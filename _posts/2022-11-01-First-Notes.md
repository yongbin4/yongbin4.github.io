**Welcomeüôå**,<br/>
this is my first jekyll blog post.<br/>

Hello ‚úåÔ∏è,<br/>
This is my life journey. From South Korea to U.A.E and U.A.E to Canada. 
## South Korea
I grew up in a small city in South Korea. I didn't expect to go abroad and study. During my school years in South Korea I had great experience with my friends and families. 

## U.A.E
My father moved his office to Dubai. He asked me one day if I am interested in study abroad. I said "Yes". It got me where I am. I studied in international school. I met different friends all over the world. I learned their culture and language. I learned how to become  friend with them. My two best friends were from Germany and India. During my high school, all I wanted to do was watching films and talk about it. I took a film studies class and created few projects. My initial goal was to go to film school after graduated. Since Korea film academy only accepted students with bachelor degree.

## Canada
I was accepted University of Alberta majoring computer science. Except films, I always had big interest in computer and new technologies. I used to play wiith c languages when I was young. (very basic stuff) After first year, I went to Korean Army to serve my country. After two long years of service I finally got back to Canada. At this point, I lost my passion in film making. I started individual studying about computer languages and tools. 
More I study and involved in projects, I am facinated by my job and working with teammates. Now I am starting a startup and multiple different projects with researchers and colleagues. I am always open to new experience!
