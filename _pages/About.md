Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Open to an internship opportunity in Summer 2023

My name is Yongbin. I am open to working in an environment where I have to acquire my task by questioning and learning. Currently working on three projects and courses. Co-founded whaler tech with a group of friends, we got our first angel and I am working on an operation and full-stack development. Preparing for a World Challenge Challenge competition. Lastly, building an app to find a missing dog using image processing. I am prepared to work in a challenging environment. I value communication and feedback. It is the way I would learn something.
