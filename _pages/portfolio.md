Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Open to an internship opportunity in Summer 2023

My name is Yongbin Kim. I am open to working in an environment where I have to acheive my task by asking questions and challenging. I am fully commited and reponsible for my jobs and roles in project I am in. Here are the projects I am working on. Firstly, **Whaler Technologies Inc.** is a startup I started with talented friends from all over the globe. We are trying to create better user experience and owner management for business owners with web3 technology.
We got our first angel invest. We plan to have our first MVP by 2023 May. I am currently working as head of operation and software engineer. I desiged our HR foundation with our HR team. I am working on a workflow with project manager. I am visualizing our vision with lean canvas and pitch our idea to StartUp accelerators. 
Secondly, I am working as a part-time research assistant at University of Alberta Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine lab. I am working on different projects with researchers. Furthermore, we had great idea of find the missing dog using image processing. We are building an app with the team called Kreaters. Finally, I am preparing a project to compete in a competition called World Challenge Challenge.
We have to come up with a solution that can solve global issue.
